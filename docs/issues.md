#### Some remarks
  express-async-errors: we need to handle error thrown by express, by default it handles sync route handlers (function), but in case of
  we mark handler with async like: `async (res, req) = {}`, then the request just hangs, to fix this issue we used express-async-errors

#### Should be careful when using this new v1.

Using the new version networking.k8s.io/v1  is recommended, but when you follow lecture 118 - build and deploy our app to Google Cloud ,this will fail with the following error

 - stderr: "error: unable to recognize
ticketing\\\\infra\\\\k8s\\\\ingress-srv.yaml\": no matches for kind \"Ingress\" in version \"networking.k8s.io/v1\"\n"
 - cause: exit status 1
The reason for this error is that, at the moment Google Cloud's latest Kubernetes version is v1.18.12 while in order to use networking.k8s.io/v1 we need v1.19+

$ kubectl version --short
Client Version: v1.19.3
Server Version: v1.18.12-gke.1210
Reference: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/90077

My local machine is installed with v1.19.3, so it can support networking.k8s.io/v1. But when deploying the app to Google Cloud using Skaffold, I need to change back to v1beta1
